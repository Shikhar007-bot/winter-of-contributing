### Operators in Python

Operators are the type of functions or the characters that explains the compiler to which mathematical, relational and logical operation it should perform, then gives the result.

### Types of Operator

1. #### Arithmetic Operator

2. #### Relational Operator

3. #### Logical Operator

   

   

#### Arithmetic Operator:

Arithmetic Operator are used to utilize mathematical activities like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

- ##### Addition operator

  ```python
  # inserting values to variables
  
  a = 10
  b = `20`
  
  # addition operation
  # storing value to c variable
  
  c = a + b
  print(c)
  
  # alter
  # we can directly perform the addition operation
  
  print(a + b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  30
  
  30
  ```

  

- ##### Subtraction operator:

  ```python
  # inserting values to variables
  
  a = 300
  b = 189
  
  # subtraction operation
  # storing value to c variable
  
  c = a - b 
  print(c)
  
  # alter
  # we can directly perform the subtraction operation
  
  print(a - b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  111
  
  111
  ```

  

- ##### Multiplication Operator:

  ```python
  # inserting values to variables
  
  a = 2890
  b = 39910
  
  # multiplication operation
  # storing value to c variable
  
  c = a * b 
  print(c)
  
  # alter
  # we can directly perform the multiplication operation
  
  print(a * b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  115339900
  115339900
  ```



- ##### Division operator:

  ```python
  # inserting values to variables
  
  a = 2890
  b = 345
  
  # division operation
  # storing value to c variable
  
  c = a / b 
  print(c)
  
  # alter
  # we can directly perform the division operation
  
  print(a / b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  8.376811594202898
  8.376811594202898
  ```

  

- ##### Modulus Operator

  ```python
  # inserting values to variables
  
  a = 7843
  b = 345
  
  # modulu operation
  # storing value to c variable
  
  c = a % b 
  print(c)
  
  # alter
  # we can directly perform the modulu operation
  
  print(a % b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```python
  253
  253
  ```

  

- ##### Exponential Operator

  ```python
  # inserting values to variables
  
  a = 78
  b = 4
  
  # exponential operation
  # storing value to c variable
  
  c = a ** b 
  print(c)
  
  # alter
  # we can directly perform the exponential operation
  
  print(a ** b)
  ```

  #####  Output:

  ```
  37015056
  37015056
  ```

  

- ##### Integer division/ Floor division

  ```python
  # inserting values to variables
  
  a = 548
  b = 344
  
  # integer/floor operation
  # storing value to c variable
  
  c = a // b 
  print(c)
  
  # alter
  # we can directly perform the integer/floor operation
  
  print(a // b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  1
  1
  ```

  

#### Relational Operator:

 These operators are used for the comparison of values and returns the result in the form of true and false.     It is also known as comparison operator.

- ##### Greater than operator:

  ```python
  a = 800
  b = 300
  
  # greater than operator
  print(a > b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```python
  True
  ```

  

- ##### Less than operator:

  ```python
  a = 800
  b = 300
  
  # less than operator
  print(a < b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  False
  ```

  

- ##### Equal To operator:

  ```python
  a = 890
  b = 890
  
  # equal To operator
  print(a == b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  True
  ```

  

- ##### Not Equal To operator:

  ```python
  a = 800
  b = 300
  
  # not equal to operator
  print(a != b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  True
  ```

  

- ##### Greater than or equal to:

  ```python
  a = 800
  b = 300
  
  # greater than or equal to operator
  print(a >= b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  True
  ```

  

- ##### Less than or equal to:

  ```python
  a = 800
  b = 300
  
  # less than or equal to operator
  print(a <= b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  False
  ```

  

#### Logical Operator:

Logical Operator are used on conditional statement by the help of logic gates. 



- ##### AND operator:

  ```python
  a = 40
  b = 50
    
  if a < 100 and b > 40:
      print("both a and b are between 40 to 100")
  else:
      print("either a is greater than 100 or b is less than 40")
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```python
  both a and b are between 40 to 100
  ```

  

- ##### OR operator:

  ```python
  a = 40
  b = 50
    
  if a > 100 or b > 40:
      print("either a is greater than 100 or b is greater than 40")
  else:
      print("both conditions are false")
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  either a is greater than 100 or b is greater than 40
  ```

  

- ##### NOT operator:

  ```python
  a = 60
    
  if a != 50:
      print("a not equal to 50")
  else:
      print("a is equal to 50")
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  a not equal to 50
  ```
