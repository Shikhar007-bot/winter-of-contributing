### Types of Operator

1. #### Arithmetic Operator

2. #### Relational Operator

3. #### Assignment Operator

   

   

#### Arithmetic Operator:

Arithmetic Operator are used to utilize mathematical activities like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

- ##### Addition operator

  ```python
  # inserting values to variables
  
  a = 10
  b = `20`
  
  # addition operation
  # storing value to c variable
  
  c = a + b
  print(c)
  
  # alter
  # we can directly perform the addition operation
  
  print(a + b)
  ```

  ##### Output:

  ```
  30
  
  30
  ```

  

- ##### Subtraction operator:

  ```python
  # inserting values to variables
  
  a = 300

  # subtraction operation
  # storing value to c variable
  
  c = a - b 
  print(c)
  
  # alter
  # we can directly perform the subtraction operation
  
  print(a - b)
  ```
